###Issues with the test cases - the values prints and the comments do not align. It might just be the comments that are wrong, not the function (i.e. not the outputs in the print statements)

def shortest_route(destinations, distances):
    """
    Find the shortest route that visits all of the destinations in a list and returns to the starting destination.

    Parameters:
    destinations (list of str): The list of destinations that the truck needs to visit.
    distances (list of tuples): A list of tuples containing the distances between pairs of destinations. Each tuple should contain three elements: (src, dest, distance), where src and dest are the names of the source and destination, respectively, and distance is the distance between them.

    Returns:
    list of str: A list of the destinations visited in the order they were visited, representing the shortest route.
