    This function implements Christofide's algorithm to generate a Hamiltonian cycle for a weighted complete graph satisfying the triangle inequality.
    It also includes the edge weights in the Hamiltonian cycle, as well as the sum of the edge weights.

    :param G: a weighted complete graph satisfying the triangle inequality; represented as a list of length-3 tuples, where the first two elements of a
        tuple are the two endpoints of an edge in G and the third element is the corresponding edge weight.

    :param start: the first (and last) node in the Hamiltonian cycle; represented as a string.

    :return: a weighted Hamiltonian cycle in G that begins and ends at the start input, as well as the sum of the edge weights; represented as a length-2
        tuple, where the first element is the sum of the edge weights, and the second element is the weighted Hamiltonian cycle, represented similarly as G
        is (i.e. as a list of length-3 tuples, where the first two elements of a tuple are the two endpoints of an edge in the cycle and the third element
        is the corresponding edge weight).
