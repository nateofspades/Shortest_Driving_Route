# Shortest_Driving_Route

Suppose you are a truck-driver who needs to make deliveries in multiple locations. Two questions you might naturally ask yourself are:

1. "What is the shortest route I can take?"
2. "At which point(s) along the route should I begin to look for a gas station?"

The focus of this project is to answer both of these questions. 

Screenshots of two examples of the end result of this project can be seen in Mapbox_Example_ATSP_Screenshots[https://github.com/nateofspades/Shortest_Driving_Route/tree/master/Mapbox/Mapbox_Example_ATSP_Screenshots] and Mapbox_Example_TSP_Screenshots[https://github.com/nateofspades/Shortest_Driving_Route/tree/master/Mapbox/Mapbox_Example_TSP_Screenshots].
