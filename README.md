# Shortest_Driving_Route

Suppose you are a truck-driver who needs to make deliveries in multiple locations. Two questions you might naturally ask yourself are:

1. "What is the shortest route I can take?"
2. "At which point(s) along the route should I begin to look for a gas station?"

The focus of this project is to answer both of these questions. 

Screenshots of two examples of the end result of this project can be seen at the links below:

[Mapbox_Example_ATSP_Screenshots](https://github.com/nateofspades/Shortest_Driving_Route/tree/master/Mapbox/Mapbox_Example_ATSP_Screenshots): This consists of 4 screenshots of a route that begins in Quebec City and makes a delivery in each of Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston and London - where the route ends. Each of these locations are labeled in **blue**. The map also labels 2 suggested locations for when the driver should begin to look for a gas station in **red**. 


[Mapbox_Example_TSP_Screenshots](https://github.com/nateofspades/Shortest_Driving_Route/tree/master/Mapbox/Mapbox_Example_TSP_Screenshots). This is another set of 4 screenshots of a route that begins in Quebec City and makes a delivery in each of Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston and London. In this route the trucker must return to the starting point, Quebec city, after visiting the last delivery point in London.
